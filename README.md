Xinha Here! Firefox Extension
========

Xinha Here! is a Firefox extension wrapper for the [Xinha HTML editor](http://xinha.python-hosting.com/). It enables WYSIWYG editing in any textarea and text box on any website. Xinha Here! opens a Xinha HTML editor in your browser allowing you to edit the data in a WYSIWYG on any website without copying and pasting to secondary HTML editor. 
Because the Xinha editor is installed on your local machine rather then a server it is both portable (use it on any website) and fast (files don't need to be transferred over the net). This extension goes great with the SpellBound spell checker extension. I use it on eBay, my WordPress blog, leaving comments on other blogs and forums, anywhere where HTML is accepted.
